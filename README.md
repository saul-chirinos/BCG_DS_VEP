# European Energy Market Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

### Business Problem

This project aims to help PowerCo, a fictional company, retain their customers. PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know the probability a customer is to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful. For the customers at risk of churning, a discount of 20% will be offered to help retain them.
